<p>
   Egeo is compounded of several projects to build the whole functionality. The main one is the Anguar 2 library that includes
   the components, services and utilities. You can read more about the library, how to work with, how to install and much
   more in the <a href="https://github.com/Stratio/egeo">Readme</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/Stratio/egeo/wiki">Wiki</a>   of the Github project.
</p>

<p>
   We use Egeo Themes to add styles to the components. By default, <a href="http://www.stratio.com">Stratio</a> provides
   the <a href="https://github.com/Stratio/egeo-theme">official egeo theme</a> which one the <a href="http://www.stratio.com">Stratio</a>'s
   apps are built. However, you can build your own theme using the <a href="https://github.com/Stratio/egeo-ui-base">Egeo UI Base library</a>.
</p>

<p>
   We also provide a <a href="https://github.com/Stratio/egeo-starter">Starter</a> you can use to begin a new Angular 2 app
   with Egeo ready to code with the whole dependencies you could need installed and configured (like Egeo, egeo-theme, Karma
   and Docker). Check the <a href="https://github.com/Stratio/egeo-starter">Readme</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/Stratio/egeo-starter/wiki">Wiki</a>   of the project to know more.
