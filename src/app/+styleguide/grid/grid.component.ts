For that, the way of build a grid in an application is exactly the same can be checked in the samples of <a href="http://flexboxgrid.com/">flexboxgrid</a>. Keep in mind that, unlike Bootstrap, with the Egeo Grid is needed to define explicitly the whole MQ classes (lg, md, sm and xs) to ensure the expected behavior. If you plan to use egeo-theme, the grid will be included in the package under the name egeo-grid.css or egeo-grid.min.css if you want the minified version. However, is perfectly possible to import the grid in your own code using the egeo-ui-base library. Check the piece of Sass code included in the sample.',
